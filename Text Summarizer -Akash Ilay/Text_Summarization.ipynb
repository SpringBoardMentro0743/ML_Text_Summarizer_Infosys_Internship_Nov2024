Manchester United revealed on Sunday that it had received a detailed proposal from Mr Glazer. A senior source at the club told the BBC: \\\"This time it's different\\\". The board is obliged to consider this deal. But the Man Utd supporters club urged the club to reject the new deal. Manchester United past and present footballers Eric Cantona and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and club manager Sir Alex Ferguson, have lent their backing to the supporters' group, Shareholders United. They have all spoken out against the bid.\\n\\nA spokesman for the supporters club said: \\\"I can't see any difference (compared to Mr Glazer's previous proposals) other than \\u00a3200m less debt. \\\"He isn't bringing any money into the club; he'll use our money to buy it.\\\"\\n\\nMr Glazer's latest move is being led by Mr Glazer's two sons, Avi and Joel, according to the Financial Times. A proposal was received by David Gill, United's chief executive, at the end of last week, pitched at about 300p a share. David Cummings, head of UK equities for Standard Life Investments, said he believed a \\\"well funded\\\" 300p a share bid would be enough for Mr Glazer to take control of the club. \\\"I do not think there is anything that Manchester United fans can do about it,\\\" he told the BBC. \\\"They can complain about it but it is curtains for them. They may not want him but they are going to get him.\\\" The US tycoon, who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months, has approached the United board with \\\"detailed proposals\\\", it has confirmed.\\n\\nMr Glazer, who owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers team, hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted. He is believed to have increased the amount of equity in the new proposal, though it is not clear by how much. For his proposal to succeed, he needs the support of United's largest shareholders, the Irish horseracing tycoons JP McManus and John Magnier. They own 29% of United through their Cubic Expression investment vehicle. Mr Glazer and his family hold a stake of 28.1%. But it is not yet known whether Mr McManus and Mr Magnier would support a Glazer bid. NM Rothschild, the investment bank, is advising Mr Glazer, according to the Financial Times. His previous adviser, JPMorgan, quit last year when Mr Glazer went ahead and voted against the appointment of three United directors to the board, against its advice. But the FT said it thought JP Morgan may still have had some role in financing Mr Glazer's latest financial proposal.\\n\",\n          \"UK net users leading TV downloads\\n\\nBritish TV viewers lead the trend of illegally downloading US shows from the net, according to research.\\n\\nNew episodes of 24, Desperate Housewives and Six Feet Under, appear on the web hours after they are shown in the US, said a report. Web tracking company Envisional said 18% of downloaders were from within the UK and that downloads of TV programmes had increased by 150% in the last year. About 70% were using file-sharing program BitTorrent, the firm said. \\\"It's now as easy to download a pirate TV show as it is to programme a VCR,\\\" said Ben Coppin from Envisional. A typical episode of 24 was downloaded by about 100,000 people globally, said the report, and an estimated 20,000 of those were from within the UK.\\n\\nFans of many popular US TV programmes, like 24, usually have to wait weeks or months until the latest series is shown in the UK. But in some cases, said the report, people were able to watch the new episodes in Britain before US audiences on the west coast of the country. \\\"Missing a television show presents little problem to anyone with a basic knowledge of the internet,\\\" explained Mr Coppin.\\n\\n\\\"Two clicks and your favourite programme is downloading. In effect, the internet is now a global video recorder.\\\" Exact figures are difficult to pin down, but it is thought that about 80,000 to 100,000 people in the UK download TV programmes. Some may just want the odd episode, others are downloading regularly. Many broadcast analysts agree that the net is radically altering the way people get content, like TV programmes. This presents a challenge to broadcasters who are concerned that channel schedules may become less important to people. It is also of concern to them because advertisements are usually cut out of the downloaded programmes. The industry has coined the term \\\"time-shifting\\\" to describe this trend of being able to watch what you want, when you want. The increased popularity of personal digital video recorders, TiVo-type boxes which automatically record programmes like Sky+, have also contributed to the trend. There are also numerous programs available on the net which automatically search and store TV programmes for viewers, effectively creating a personal video recorder on a computer.\\n\\nWithin half an hour, recorded episodes can be uploaded - or posted - onto file-sharing networks or other download sites. Because they tend to be shorter then full-length films, they can be processed - digitised - quickly. More people with high-speed broadband connections in the UK also means that episodes can be downloaded quickly.\\n\\nAccording to Jupiter Research 40% of homes with broadband say it helps them pick and choose the programmes they want to see or that friends have recommended. The Envisional reports said that the TV industry should consider offering a legal way to download shows. The BBC ran a trial of what it calls the Interactive Media Player (iMP) last year, which was based on a peer-to-peer distribution model. It let people download programmes it held the rights to up to eight days after they had already aired. It is looking to do a more expansive trial later this year. The BBC already allows radio fans to hear programmes they missed online up to a week after broadcast. About six million people in the UK now have a fast, always-on net connection via cable or phone lines.\\n\",\n          \"Pavey focuses on indoor success\\n\\nJo Pavey will miss January's View From Great Edinburgh International Cross Country to focus on preparing for the European Indoor Championships in March.\\n\\nThe 31-year-old was third behind Hayley Yelling and Justyna Bak in last week's European Cross Country Championships but she prefers to race on the track. \\\"It was great winning bronze but I'm wary of injuries and must concentrate on the indoor season,\\\" she said. \\\"Because of previous injuries I don't even run up hills in training.\\\" Pavey, who came fifth in the 5,000m at the Athens Olympics, helped the British cross country team win the team silver medal in Heringsdorf last week. She is likely to start her 3,000m season with a race in either Boston or Stuttgart at the end of January.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2081,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Argentina's Agustin Calleri beat fourth seed Jiri Novak 7-5 6-1 in a battle of former champions at the Mexican Open.Eighth seed Nadal, who picked up his second ATP title when he beat Alberto Martin in last week's Brazil Open, saw off the Argentine third seed 7-5 6-3.Calleri will face Albert Montanes in the semi-finals after the Spaniard ousted sixth seed Filippo Volandri of Italy 4-6 6-3 6-4.He now meets Argentine wild card Mariano Puerta, who followed up his win over top seed Carlos Moya by overcoming Spain's Felix Mantilla, 6-4 3-6 7-6.\",\n          \"Wal-Mart said it was investigating the claims but had no plans to pull the CD.Trevin Skeens alleges Wal-Mart knew of the offending word because it had censored it on its music sales website.The lawsuit seeks to force Wal-Mart to censor the music or remove it from its stores in Maryland.The lawsuit, filed in Washington County, alleges Wal-Mart deceived customers by not putting warning labels on the cover.\\\"While Wal-Mart sets high standards, it would not be possible to eliminate every image, word or topic that an individual might find objectionable,\\\" Wal-Mart spokesman Guy Whitcomb told the Herald-Mail of Hagerstown.\",\n          \"Online communities set up by the UK government could encourage public debate and build trust, says the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR).But he adds, government could play a bigger role in setting up systems of trust for online communities too.In its report, Is Online Community A Policy Tool?, the IPPR also asks if ID cards could help create safer online communities.With 53% of UK households now with access to the net, the government, suggests Mr Davies, could act as an intermediary or \\\"middleman\\\" to set up public online places of debate and exchange to encourage more \\\"cosmopolitan politics\\\" and public trust in policy.\\\"Government already plays a critical role in helping citizens trade with each other online.They could provide the basis for a secure authentication system which could have value for peer-to-peer interaction online.Although the net is becoming part of local and central government, its potential has not yet been fully exploited to create an online \\\"commons\\\" for public debate.Proposals for ID cards, for instance, could also be widened to see if they could be used online.There is a role for public bodies like the BBC, libraries, and government to bring people back into public debate again instead of millions of \\\"cliques\\\" talking to each other, he added.The key idea to take from systems such as eBay and other online communities is letting members rate each other's reputation by how they treat other members.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Manchester United revealed on Sunday that it had received a detailed proposal from Mr Glazer. A senior source at the club told the BBC: \\\"This time it's different\\\". The board is obliged to consider this deal. But the Man Utd supporters club urged the club to reject the new deal. Manchester United past and present footballers Eric Cantona and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and club manager Sir Alex Ferguson, have lent their backing to the supporters' group, Shareholders United. They have all spoken out against the bid.\\n\\nA spokesman for the supporters club said: \\\"I can't see any difference (compared to Mr Glazer's previous proposals) other than \\u00a3200m less debt. \\\"He isn't bringing any money into the club; he'll use our money to buy it.\\\"\\n\\nMr Glazer's latest move is being led by Mr Glazer's two sons, Avi and Joel, according to the Financial Times. A proposal was received by David Gill, United's chief executive, at the end of last week, pitched at about 300p a share. David Cummings, head of UK equities for Standard Life Investments, said he believed a \\\"well funded\\\" 300p a share bid would be enough for Mr Glazer to take control of the club. \\\"I do not think there is anything that Manchester United fans can do about it,\\\" he told the BBC. \\\"They can complain about it but it is curtains for them. They may not want him but they are going to get him.\\\" The US tycoon, who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months, has approached the United board with \\\"detailed proposals\\\", it has confirmed.\\n\\nMr Glazer, who owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers team, hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted. He is believed to have increased the amount of equity in the new proposal, though it is not clear by how much. For his proposal to succeed, he needs the support of United's largest shareholders, the Irish horseracing tycoons JP McManus and John Magnier. They own 29% of United through their Cubic Expression investment vehicle. Mr Glazer and his family hold a stake of 28.1%. But it is not yet known whether Mr McManus and Mr Magnier would support a Glazer bid. NM Rothschild, the investment bank, is advising Mr Glazer, according to the Financial Times. His previous adviser, JPMorgan, quit last year when Mr Glazer went ahead and voted against the appointment of three United directors to the board, against its advice. But the FT said it thought JP Morgan may still have had some role in financing Mr Glazer's latest financial proposal.\\n\",\n          \"UK net users leading TV downloads\\n\\nBritish TV viewers lead the trend of illegally downloading US shows from the net, according to research.\\n\\nNew episodes of 24, Desperate Housewives and Six Feet Under, appear on the web hours after they are shown in the US, said a report. Web tracking company Envisional said 18% of downloaders were from within the UK and that downloads of TV programmes had increased by 150% in the last year. About 70% were using file-sharing program BitTorrent, the firm said. \\\"It's now as easy to download a pirate TV show as it is to programme a VCR,\\\" said Ben Coppin from Envisional. A typical episode of 24 was downloaded by about 100,000 people globally, said the report, and an estimated 20,000 of those were from within the UK.\\n\\nFans of many popular US TV programmes, like 24, usually have to wait weeks or months until the latest series is shown in the UK. But in some cases, said the report, people were able to watch the new episodes in Britain before US audiences on the west coast of the country. \\\"Missing a television show presents little problem to anyone with a basic knowledge of the internet,\\\" explained Mr Coppin.\\n\\n\\\"Two clicks and your favourite programme is downloading. In effect, the internet is now a global video recorder.\\\" Exact figures are difficult to pin down, but it is thought that about 80,000 to 100,000 people in the UK download TV programmes. Some may just want the odd episode, others are downloading regularly. Many broadcast analysts agree that the net is radically altering the way people get content, like TV programmes. This presents a challenge to broadcasters who are concerned that channel schedules may become less important to people. It is also of concern to them because advertisements are usually cut out of the downloaded programmes. The industry has coined the term \\\"time-shifting\\\" to describe this trend of being able to watch what you want, when you want. The increased popularity of personal digital video recorders, TiVo-type boxes which automatically record programmes like Sky+, have also contributed to the trend. There are also numerous programs available on the net which automatically search and store TV programmes for viewers, effectively creating a personal video recorder on a computer.\\n\\nWithin half an hour, recorded episodes can be uploaded - or posted - onto file-sharing networks or other download sites. Because they tend to be shorter then full-length films, they can be processed - digitised - quickly. More people with high-speed broadband connections in the UK also means that episodes can be downloaded quickly.\\n\\nAccording to Jupiter Research 40% of homes with broadband say it helps them pick and choose the programmes they want to see or that friends have recommended. The Envisional reports said that the TV industry should consider offering a legal way to download shows. The BBC ran a trial of what it calls the Interactive Media Player (iMP) last year, which was based on a peer-to-peer distribution model. It let people download programmes it held the rights to up to eight days after they had already aired. It is looking to do a more expansive trial later this year. The BBC already allows radio fans to hear programmes they missed online up to a week after broadcast. About six million people in the UK now have a fast, always-on net connection via cable or phone lines.\\n\",\n          \"Pavey focuses on indoor success\\n\\nJo Pavey will miss January's View From Great Edinburgh International Cross Country to focus on preparing for the European Indoor Championships in March.\\n\\nThe 31-year-old was third behind Hayley Yelling and Justyna Bak in last week's European Cross Country Championships but she prefers to race on the track. \\\"It was great winning bronze but I'm wary of injuries and must concentrate on the indoor season,\\\" she said. \\\"Because of previous injuries I don't even run up hills in training.\\\" Pavey, who came fifth in the 5,000m at the Athens Olympics, helped the British cross country team win the team silver medal in Heringsdorf last week. She is likely to start her 3,000m season with a race in either Boston or Stuttgart at the end of January.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n

      \"no half measures with half-life 2\\n\\ncould half-life 2 possibly live up to the hype? after almost two years of tantalising previews and infuriating delays it's safe to say that this is the most highly-anticipated computer game of all time.\\n\\nfortunately, it doesn't merely live up to its promise, but exceeds it. no-one who plays the finished product will wonder why it took so long. the impression is of a game that has been endlessly refined to get as close to perfection as could realistically be hoped. all the money - or indeed time - is on the screen. the player sees things through the eyes of gordon freeman, the bespectacled scientist who starred in the original 1998 half-life. having survived that skirmish in an desolate monster-infested research facility, he's back in another foreboding troublespot - the enigmatic city 17. it has the look of a beautiful eastern european city, but as soon as your train pulls in to the station, it's clear that all is not well here. sinister police patrol the unkempt streets, and the oppressive atmosphere clobbers you like a sledgehammer. a casual smattering of the nightmarish creatures from the first game makes this an even less pleasant place to be.\\n\\nyou are herded around like a prisoner and have to mingle with a few freedom-fighting civilians to gather information and progress in your task. it is not immediately explained what your objectives are, nor precisely why everything is so ravaged. finding out step-by-step is all part of the experience, although you never fully get to understand what it was all about. that does not really matter. hl2 does not waste energy blinding you with plot. underplaying the narrative in this way is gloriously effective, and immerses the player in the most vivid, convincing and impressive virtual world they are likely to have seen. there are no cut-scenes to interrupt the flow. exposition is accomplished by other characters stopping to talk directly to you.\\n\\nwhereas the highly impressive doom iii felt like a top-notch theme park thrill-ride, wandering through half-life's world truly does feel like being part of a movie.\\n\\nconsidering its sophistication, the game runs surprisingly well on computers that only just match the modest minimum specifications. but if ever there was an incentive to upgrade your pc's components, this is it. on our test machine - an alienware system with an athlon 3500+ processor and ati's radeon x800 video card - everything ran at full quality without trouble, and the visual experience was simply jaw-dropping. it is not simply that the surfaces, textures and light effects push the technical envelope without mercy, but that such care and artistic flair has gone into designing them. the haunting, grim landscapes become strangely beautiful. luckily you get time to pause mid-task and marvel at the awesome graphical flourishes of your surroundings. so impressive are the physics that you'll find yourself hurling bits of rubbish around and prodding floating corpses just to marvel at the lifelike way they move. there are puzzles to be solved along the way, pitched at about the right difficulty, but most progress is achieved by force. freeman is quickly reunited with the original game's famous crowbar, and an array of more sophisticated weapons soon follow.\\n\\nvirtually anything not nailed to the floor can be interacted with, and in realistic fashion. you will be wowed by the attention-to-detail as you chip bits of plaster off walls, chase a pigeon out of your way, or dodge exploding barrels as they ping around at deadly speed. at times half-life 2 feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to, and in a curious way, its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome. running around on foot is great enough, but jumping into vehicles proves even more fun. human foes are rendered just as well as alien ones. the stealth sections are as exhilarating as the open gun battles. in gameplay terms, hl2 somehow gets almost everything perfect. and without resorting to the zombies-leaping-out-of-shadows approach of doom iii, it's all incredibly unsettling. the vacant environment is distinctly eerie, and at one point i even caught myself hesitating to go down a murky tunnel for fear of what might be inside.\\n\\nthe game does have a couple of problems. firstly, the carefully-scripted way that you progress through each level might irk some people.\\n\\na lot of things are meticulously choreographed to happen on cue, which makes for exciting moments, but may be an annoyance to some players and limit the appeal of playing again once you've completed it. if you like things open-ended and free-ranging, far cry will be a lot more pleasing. but the real downside is the hassle of getting the game to run. installing it proved a life-draining siege that would test a saint's patience. developer valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy. the box does warn you of this anti-piracy measure, but does not say just how many components have to be downloaded. the time spent doing this will depend on your connection speed, the temperamental valve servers and the time of day, but it can take hours. it would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances - but luckily, half-life 2 is up to the challenge. it is surely the best thing in its genre, and possibly, many will feel, of any genre. the bar has been raised, and so far out of sight that you have to sympathise with any game that tries to do anything remotely similar in the near future.\\n\\nhalf-life 2 is out now for the pc\\n\",\n          \"veteran martinez wins thai title\\n\\nconchita martinez won her first title in almost five years with victory over anna-lena

Manchester United revealed on Sunday that it had received a detailed proposal from Mr Glazer. A senior source at the club told the BBC: \\\"This time it's different\\\". The board is obliged to consider this deal. But the Man Utd supporters club urged the club to reject the new deal. Manchester United past and present footballers Eric Cantona and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and club manager Sir Alex Ferguson, have lent their backing to the supporters' group, Shareholders United. They have all spoken out against the bid.\\n\\nA spokesman for the supporters club said: \\\"I can't see any difference (compared to Mr Glazer's previous proposals) other than \\u00a3200m less debt. \\\"He isn't bringing any money into the club; he'll use our money to buy it.\\\"\\n\\nMr Glazer's latest move is being led by Mr Glazer's two sons, Avi and Joel, according to the Financial Times. A proposal was received by David Gill, United's chief executive, at the end of last week, pitched at about 300p a share. David Cummings, head of UK equities for Standard Life Investments, said he believed a \\\"well funded\\\" 300p a share bid would be enough for Mr Glazer to take control of the club. \\\"I do not think there is anything that Manchester United fans can do about it,\\\" he told the BBC. \\\"They can complain about it but it is curtains for them. They may not want him but they are going to get him.\\\" The US tycoon, who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months, has approached the United board with \\\"detailed proposals\\\", it has confirmed.\\n\\nMr Glazer, who owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers team, hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted. He is believed to have increased the amount of equity in the new proposal, though it is not clear by how much. For his proposal to succeed, he needs the support of United's largest shareholders, the Irish horseracing tycoons JP McManus and John Magnier. They own 29% of United through their Cubic Expression investment vehicle. Mr Glazer and his family hold a stake of 28.1%. But it is not yet known whether Mr McManus and Mr Magnier would support a Glazer bid. NM Rothschild, the investment bank, is advising Mr Glazer, according to the Financial Times. His previous adviser, JPMorgan, quit last year when Mr Glazer went ahead and voted against the appointment of three United directors to the board, against its advice. But the FT said it thought JP Morgan may still have had some role in financing Mr Glazer's latest financial proposal.\\n\",\n          \"UK net users leading TV downloads\\n\\nBritish TV viewers lead the trend of illegally downloading US shows from the net, according to research.\\n\\nNew episodes of 24, Desperate Housewives and Six Feet Under, appear on the web hours after they are shown in the US, said a report. Web tracking company Envisional said 18% of downloaders were from within the UK and that downloads of TV programmes had increased by 150% in the last year. About 70% were using file-sharing program BitTorrent, the firm said. \\\"It's now as easy to download a pirate TV show as it is to programme a VCR,\\\" said Ben Coppin from Envisional. A typical episode of 24 was downloaded by about 100,000 people globally, said the report, and an estimated 20,000 of those were from within the UK.\\n\\nFans of many popular US TV programmes, like 24, usually have to wait weeks or months until the latest series is shown in the UK. But in some cases, said the report, people were able to watch the new episodes in Britain before US audiences on the west coast of the country. \\\"Missing a television show presents little problem to anyone with a basic knowledge of the internet,\\\" explained Mr Coppin.\\n\\n\\\"Two clicks and your favourite programme is downloading. In effect, the internet is now a global video recorder.\\\" Exact figures are difficult to pin down, but it is thought that about 80,000 to 100,000 people in the UK download TV programmes. Some may just want the odd episode, others are downloading regularly. Many broadcast analysts agree that the net is radically altering the way people get content, like TV programmes. This presents a challenge to broadcasters who are concerned that channel schedules may become less important to people. It is also of concern to them because advertisements are usually cut out of the downloaded programmes. The industry has coined the term \\\"time-shifting\\\" to describe this trend of being able to watch what you want, when you want. The increased popularity of personal digital video recorders, TiVo-type boxes which automatically record programmes like Sky+, have also contributed to the trend. There are also numerous programs available on the net which automatically search and store TV programmes for viewers, effectively creating a personal video recorder on a computer.\\n\\nWithin half an hour, recorded episodes can be uploaded - or posted - onto file-sharing networks or other download sites. Because they tend to be shorter then full-length films, they can be processed - digitised - quickly. More people with high-speed broadband connections in the UK also means that episodes can be downloaded quickly.\\n\\nAccording to Jupiter Research 40% of homes with broadband say it helps them pick and choose the programmes they want to see or that friends have recommended. The Envisional reports said that the TV industry should consider offering a legal way to download shows. The BBC ran a trial of what it calls the Interactive Media Player (iMP) last year, which was based on a peer-to-peer distribution model. It let people download programmes it held the rights to up to eight days after they had already aired. It is looking to do a more expansive trial later this year. The BBC already allows radio fans to hear programmes they missed online up to a week after broadcast. About six million people in the UK now have a fast, always-on net connection via cable or phone lines.\\n\",\n          \"Pavey focuses on indoor success\\n\\nJo Pavey will miss January's View From Great Edinburgh International Cross Country to focus on preparing for the European Indoor Championships in March.\\n\\nThe 31-year-old was third behind Hayley Yelling and Justyna Bak in last week's European Cross Country Championships but she prefers to race on the track. \\\"It was great winning bronze but I'm wary of injuries and must concentrate on the indoor season,\\\" she said. \\\"Because of previous injuries I don't even run up hills in training.\\\" Pavey, who came fifth in the 5,000m at the Athens Olympics, helped the British cross country team win the team silver medal in Heringsdorf last week. She is likely to start her 3,000m season with a race in either Boston or Stuttgart at the end of January.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n

      \"no half measures with half-life 2\\n\\ncould half-life 2 possibly live up to the hype? after almost two years of tantalising previews and infuriating delays it is safe to say that this is the most highly-anticipated computer game of all time.\\n\\nfortunately, it does not merely live up to its promise, but exceeds it. no-one who plays the finished product will wonder why it took so long. the impression is of a game that has been endlessly refined to get as close to perfection as could realistically be hoped. all the money - or indeed time - is on the screen. the player sees things through the eyes of gordon freeman, the bespectacled scientist who starred in the original 1998 half-life. having survived that skirmish in an desolate monster-infested research facility, he is back in another foreboding troublespot - the enigmatic city 17. it has the look of a beautiful eastern european city, but as soon as your train pulls in to the station, it is clear that all is not well here. sinister police patrol the unkempt streets, and the oppressive atmosphere clobbers you like a sledgehammer. a casual smattering of the nightmarish creatures from the first game makes this an even less pleasant place to be.\\n\\nyou are herded around like a prisoner and have to mingle with a few freedom-fighting civilians to gather information and progress in your task. it is not immediately explained what your objectives are, nor precisely why everything is so ravaged. finding out step-by-step is all part of the experience, although you never fully get to understand what it was all about. that does not really matter. hl2 does not waste energy blinding you with plot. underplaying the narrative in this way is gloriously effective, and immerses the player in the most vivid, convincing and impressive virtual world they are likely to have seen. there are no cut-scenes to interrupt the flow. exposition is accomplished by other characters stopping to talk directly to you.\\n\\nwhereas the highly impressive doom iii felt like a top-notch theme park thrill-ride, wandering through half-life's world truly does feel like being part of a movie.\\n\\nconsidering its sophistication, the game runs surprisingly well on computers that only just match the modest minimum specifications. but if ever there was an incentive to upgrade your pc's components, this is it. on our test machine - an alienware system with an athlon 3500+ processor and ati's radeon x800 video card - everything ran at full quality without trouble, and the visual experience was simply jaw-dropping. it is not simply that the surfaces, textures and light effects push the technical envelope without mercy, but that such care and artistic flair has gone into designing them. the haunting, grim landscapes become strangely beautiful. luckily you get time to pause mid-task and marvel at the awesome graphical flourishes of your surroundings. so impressive are the physics that you will find yourself hurling bits of rubbish around and prodding floating corpses just to marvel at the lifelike way they move. there are puzzles to be solved along the way, pitched at about the right difficulty, but most progress is achieved by force. freeman is quickly reunited with the original game's famous crowbar, and an array of more sophisticated weapons soon follow.\\n\\nvirtually anything not nailed to the floor can be interacted with, and in realistic fashion. you will be wowed by the attention-to-detail as you chip bits of plaster off walls, chase a pigeon out of your way, or dodge exploding barrels as they ping around at deadly speed. at times half-life 2 feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to, and in a curious way, its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome. running around on foot is great enough, but jumping into vehicles proves even more fun. human foes are rendered just as well as alien ones. the stealth sections are as exhilarating as the open gun battles. in gameplay terms, hl2 somehow gets almost everything perfect. and without resorting to the zombies-leaping-out-of-shadows approach of doom iii, it is all incredibly unsettling. the vacant environment is distinctly eerie, and at one point i even caught myself hesitating to go down a murky tunnel for fear of what might be inside.\\n\\nthe game does have a couple of problems. firstly, the carefully-scripted way that you progress through each level might irk some people.\\n\\na lot of things are meticulously choreographed to happen on cue, which makes for exciting moments, but may be an annoyance to some players and limit the appeal of playing again once you have completed it. if you like things open-ended and free-ranging, far cry will be a lot more pleasing. but the real downside is the hassle of getting the game to run. installing it proved a life-draining siege that would test a saint's patience. developer valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy. the box does warn you of this anti-piracy measure, but does not say just how many components have to be downloaded. the time spent doing this will depend on your connection speed, the temperamental valve servers and the time of day, but it can take hours. it would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances - but luckily, half-life 2 is up to the challenge. it is surely the best thing in its genre, and possibly, many will feel, of any genre. the bar has been raised, and so far out of sight that you have to sympathise with any game that tries to do anything remotely similar in the near future.\\n\\nhalf-life 2 is out now for the pc\\n\",\n          \"veteran martinez wins thai title\\n\\nconchita martinez won her first title in almost five years with victory over anna-lena

who is playing her last season on the tour. \\\"to come through like that in an important match feels good. \\\"it is been nearly five years and i did not think i could do it.\\\" groenefeld was the more powerful player but could not match her opponent's relentless accuracy. \\\"it was my first final, a new experience,\\\" said the german. \\\"i think she played a good match, a tough match, but i

Manchester United revealed on Sunday that it had received a detailed proposal from Mr Glazer. A senior source at the club told the BBC: \\\"This time it's different\\\". The board is obliged to consider this deal. But the Man Utd supporters club urged the club to reject the new deal. Manchester United past and present footballers Eric Cantona and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and club manager Sir Alex Ferguson, have lent their backing to the supporters' group, Shareholders United. They have all spoken out against the bid.\\n\\nA spokesman for the supporters club said: \\\"I can't see any difference (compared to Mr Glazer's previous proposals) other than \\u00a3200m less debt. \\\"He isn't bringing any money into the club; he'll use our money to buy it.\\\"\\n\\nMr Glazer's latest move is being led by Mr Glazer's two sons, Avi and Joel, according to the Financial Times. A proposal was received by David Gill, United's chief executive, at the end of last week, pitched at about 300p a share. David Cummings, head of UK equities for Standard Life Investments, said he believed a \\\"well funded\\\" 300p a share bid would be enough for Mr Glazer to take control of the club. \\\"I do not think there is anything that Manchester United fans can do about it,\\\" he told the BBC. \\\"They can complain about it but it is curtains for them. They may not want him but they are going to get him.\\\" The US tycoon, who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months, has approached the United board with \\\"detailed proposals\\\", it has confirmed.\\n\\nMr Glazer, who owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers team, hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted. He is believed to have increased the amount of equity in the new proposal, though it is not clear by how much. For his proposal to succeed, he needs the support of United's largest shareholders, the Irish horseracing tycoons JP McManus and John Magnier. They own 29% of United through their Cubic Expression investment vehicle. Mr Glazer and his family hold a stake of 28.1%. But it is not yet known whether Mr McManus and Mr Magnier would support a Glazer bid. NM Rothschild, the investment bank, is advising Mr Glazer, according to the Financial Times. His previous adviser, JPMorgan, quit last year when Mr Glazer went ahead and voted against the appointment of three United directors to the board, against its advice. But the FT said it thought JP Morgan may still have had some role in financing Mr Glazer's latest financial proposal.\\n\",\n          \"UK net users leading TV downloads\\n\\nBritish TV viewers lead the trend of illegally downloading US shows from the net, according to research.\\n\\nNew episodes of 24, Desperate Housewives and Six Feet Under, appear on the web hours after they are shown in the US, said a report. Web tracking company Envisional said 18% of downloaders were from within the UK and that downloads of TV programmes had increased by 150% in the last year. About 70% were using file-sharing program BitTorrent, the firm said. \\\"It's now as easy to download a pirate TV show as it is to programme a VCR,\\\" said Ben Coppin from Envisional. A typical episode of 24 was downloaded by about 100,000 people globally, said the report, and an estimated 20,000 of those were from within the UK.\\n\\nFans of many popular US TV programmes, like 24, usually have to wait weeks or months until the latest series is shown in the UK. But in some cases, said the report, people were able to watch the new episodes in Britain before US audiences on the west coast of the country. \\\"Missing a television show presents little problem to anyone with a basic knowledge of the internet,\\\" explained Mr Coppin.\\n\\n\\\"Two clicks and your favourite programme is downloading. In effect, the internet is now a global video recorder.\\\" Exact figures are difficult to pin down, but it is thought that about 80,000 to 100,000 people in the UK download TV programmes. Some may just want the odd episode, others are downloading regularly. Many broadcast analysts agree that the net is radically altering the way people get content, like TV programmes. This presents a challenge to broadcasters who are concerned that channel schedules may become less important to people. It is also of concern to them because advertisements are usually cut out of the downloaded programmes. The industry has coined the term \\\"time-shifting\\\" to describe this trend of being able to watch what you want, when you want. The increased popularity of personal digital video recorders, TiVo-type boxes which automatically record programmes like Sky+, have also contributed to the trend. There are also numerous programs available on the net which automatically search and store TV programmes for viewers, effectively creating a personal video recorder on a computer.\\n\\nWithin half an hour, recorded episodes can be uploaded - or posted - onto file-sharing networks or other download sites. Because they tend to be shorter then full-length films, they can be processed - digitised - quickly. More people with high-speed broadband connections in the UK also means that episodes can be downloaded quickly.\\n\\nAccording to Jupiter Research 40% of homes with broadband say it helps them pick and choose the programmes they want to see or that friends have recommended. The Envisional reports said that the TV industry should consider offering a legal way to download shows. The BBC ran a trial of what it calls the Interactive Media Player (iMP) last year, which was based on a peer-to-peer distribution model. It let people download programmes it held the rights to up to eight days after they had already aired. It is looking to do a more expansive trial later this year. The BBC already allows radio fans to hear programmes they missed online up to a week after broadcast. About six million people in the UK now have a fast, always-on net connection via cable or phone lines.\\n\",\n          \"Pavey focuses on indoor success\\n\\nJo Pavey will miss January's View From Great Edinburgh International Cross Country to focus on preparing for the European Indoor Championships in March.\\n\\nThe 31-year-old was third behind Hayley Yelling and Justyna Bak in last week's European Cross Country Championships but she prefers to race on the track. \\\"It was great winning bronze but I'm wary of injuries and must concentrate on the indoor season,\\\" she said. \\\"Because of previous injuries I don't even run up hills in training.\\\" Pavey, who came fifth in the 5,000m at the Athens Olympics, helped the British cross country team win the team silver medal in Heringsdorf last week. She is likely to start her 3,000m season with a race in either Boston or Stuttgart at the end of January.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n

now with access to the net, the government, suggests Mr Davies, could act as an intermediary or \\\"middleman\\\" to set up public online places of debate and exchange to encourage more \\\"cosmopolitan politics\\\" and public trust in policy.\\\"Government already plays a critical role in helping citizens trade with each other online.They could provide the basis for a secure

create an online \\\"commons\\\" for public debate.Proposals for ID cards, for instance, could also be widened to see if they could be used online.There is a role for public bodies like the BBC, libraries, and government to bring people back into public debate again instead of millions of \\\"cliques\\\" talking to each other, he added.The key idea to take from systems such as eBay and other online communities is letting members rate each other's reputation by how they treat other members.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n

is still the question of turning up and transferring that freshness into positive results when the referee signals the start of the game already ireland are being earmarked as hot favourites in many

their first triple crown for 19 years they can live up to their success and take a further step up the ladder osullivan has kept faith and displayed loyalty to his players and they have repaid him in

Manchester United revealed on Sunday that it had received a detailed proposal from Mr Glazer. A senior source at the club told the BBC: \\\"This time it's different\\\". The board is obliged to consider this deal. But the Man Utd supporters club urged the club to reject the new deal. Manchester United past and present footballers Eric Cantona and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and club manager Sir Alex Ferguson, have lent their backing to the supporters' group, Shareholders United. They have all spoken out against the bid.\\n\\nA spokesman for the supporters club said: \\\"I can't see any difference (compared to Mr Glazer's previous proposals) other than \\u00a3200m less debt. \\\"He isn't bringing any money into the club; he'll use our money to buy it.\\\"\\n\\nMr Glazer's latest move is being led by Mr Glazer's two sons, Avi and Joel, according to the Financial Times. A proposal was received by David Gill, United's chief executive, at the end of last week, pitched at about 300p a share. David Cummings, head of UK equities for Standard Life Investments, said he believed a \\\"well funded\\\" 300p a share bid would be enough for Mr Glazer to take control of the club. \\\"I do not think there is anything that Manchester United fans can do about it,\\\" he told the BBC. \\\"They can complain about it but it is curtains for them. They may not want him but they are going to get him.\\\" The US tycoon, who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months, has approached the United board with \\\"detailed proposals\\\", it has confirmed.\\n\\nMr Glazer, who owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers team, hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted. He is believed to have increased the amount of equity in the new proposal, though it is not clear by how much. For his proposal to succeed, he needs the support of United's largest shareholders, the Irish horseracing tycoons JP McManus and John Magnier. They own 29% of United through their Cubic Expression investment vehicle. Mr Glazer and his family hold a stake of 28.1%. But it is not yet known whether Mr McManus and Mr Magnier would support a Glazer bid. NM Rothschild, the investment bank, is advising Mr Glazer, according to the Financial Times. His previous adviser, JPMorgan, quit last year when Mr Glazer went ahead and voted against the appointment of three United directors to the board, against its advice. But the FT said it thought JP Morgan may still have had some role in financing Mr Glazer's latest financial proposal.\\n\",\n          \"UK net users leading TV downloads\\n\\nBritish TV viewers lead the trend of illegally downloading US shows from the net, according to research.\\n\\nNew episodes of 24, Desperate Housewives and Six Feet Under, appear on the web hours after they are shown in the US, said a report. Web tracking company Envisional said 18% of downloaders were from within the UK and that downloads of TV programmes had increased by 150% in the last year. About 70% were using file-sharing program BitTorrent, the firm said. \\\"It's now as easy to download a pirate TV show as it is to programme a VCR,\\\" said Ben Coppin from Envisional. A typical episode of 24 was downloaded by about 100,000 people globally, said the report, and an estimated 20,000 of those were from within the UK.\\n\\nFans of many popular US TV programmes, like 24, usually have to wait weeks or months until the latest series is shown in the UK. But in some cases, said the report, people were able to watch the new episodes in Britain before US audiences on the west coast of the country. \\\"Missing a television show presents little problem to anyone with a basic knowledge of the internet,\\\" explained Mr Coppin.\\n\\n\\\"Two clicks and your favourite programme is downloading. In effect, the internet is now a global video recorder.\\\" Exact figures are difficult to pin down, but it is thought that about 80,000 to 100,000 people in the UK download TV programmes. Some may just want the odd episode, others are downloading regularly. Many broadcast analysts agree that the net is radically altering the way people get content, like TV programmes. This presents a challenge to broadcasters who are concerned that channel schedules may become less important to people. It is also of concern to them because advertisements are usually cut out of the downloaded programmes. The industry has coined the term \\\"time-shifting\\\" to describe this trend of being able to watch what you want, when you want. The increased popularity of personal digital video recorders, TiVo-type boxes which automatically record programmes like Sky+, have also contributed to the trend. There are also numerous programs available on the net which automatically search and store TV programmes for viewers, effectively creating a personal video recorder on a computer.\\n\\nWithin half an hour, recorded episodes can be uploaded - or posted - onto file-sharing networks or other download sites. Because they tend to be shorter then full-length films, they can be processed - digitised - quickly. More people with high-speed broadband connections in the UK also means that episodes can be downloaded quickly.\\n\\nAccording to Jupiter Research 40% of homes with broadband say it helps them pick and choose the programmes they want to see or that friends have recommended. The Envisional reports said that the TV industry should consider offering a legal way to download shows. The BBC ran a trial of what it calls the Interactive Media Player (iMP) last year, which was based on a peer-to-peer distribution model. It let people download programmes it held the rights to up to eight days after they had already aired. It is looking to do a more expansive trial later this year. The BBC already allows radio fans to hear programmes they missed online up to a week after broadcast. About six million people in the UK now have a fast, always-on net connection via cable or phone lines.\\n\",\n          \"Pavey focuses on indoor success\\n\\nJo Pavey will miss January's View From Great Edinburgh International Cross Country to focus on preparing for the European Indoor Championships in March.\\n\\nThe 31-year-old was third behind Hayley Yelling and Justyna Bak in last week's European Cross Country Championships but she prefers to race on the track. \\\"It was great winning bronze but I'm wary of injuries and must concentrate on the indoor season,\\\" she said. \\\"Because of previous injuries I don't even run up hills in training.\\\" Pavey, who came fifth in the 5,000m at the Athens Olympics, helped the British cross country team win the team silver medal in Heringsdorf last week. She is likely to start her 3,000m season with a race in either Boston or Stuttgart at the end of January.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n

now with access to the net, the government, suggests Mr Davies, could act as an intermediary or \\\"middleman\\\" to set up public online places of debate and exchange to encourage more \\\"cosmopolitan politics\\\" and public trust in policy.\\\"Government already plays a critical role in helping citizens trade with each other online.They could provide the basis for a secure authentication system which could have value for peer-to-peer interaction online.Although the net is becoming part of local and central government, its potential has not yet been fully exploited to create an online \\\"commons\\\" for public debate.Proposals for ID cards, for instance, could also be widened to see if they could be used online.There is a role for public bodies like the BBC, libraries, and government to bring people back into public debate again instead of millions of \\\"cliques\\\" talking to each other, he added.The key idea to take from systems such as eBay and other online communities is letting members rate each other's reputation by how they treat other members.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n
